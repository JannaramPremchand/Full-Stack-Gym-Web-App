# SangLehar FitnessFlow: Gym Fitness Management System

## Introduction
The aim of creating this project is to bring every manual activity of the gym to an online platform. This digital transformation simplifies the gym staff's tasks, which were previously handled on paper, making them more efficient and organized. The website also benefits gym members by enabling them to track attendance, manage schedules, and perform other activities online. Additionally, guest users can apply for membership directly through the website. Trainers can monitor their attendance, track members' workout progress, and create workout schedules and diet charts for members.
