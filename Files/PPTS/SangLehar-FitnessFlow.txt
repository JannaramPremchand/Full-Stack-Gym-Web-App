Abstract
The Gym Fitness Management System is a web-based application developed using Django (Python), HTML5, CSS,
JavaScript, and MySQL, aiming to modernize gym operations by digitizing every manual task. The project
provides a centralized platform for administrators, trainers, members, and guests to interact with various gym-
related activities efficiently.



The system allows administrators to manage gym memberships, attendance, products, payments, and fitness
content, while trainers can create and assign personalized workout schedules and diet plans for members.
Members can access these plans, track attendance, shop for gym products, and engage with fitness blogs and
videos. Additionally, guests can explore the platform and seamlessly register for gym memberships.
