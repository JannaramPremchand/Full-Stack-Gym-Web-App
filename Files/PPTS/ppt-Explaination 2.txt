Slide 4: Introduction
🎤 What to Say:
*"Many gyms still rely on manual processes for membership management, attendance tracking, and payments. This leads to inefficiencies, errors, and wasted time.

Our system replaces traditional paper-based methods with a fully digital, automated, and efficient solution. It enables real-time tracking, automated reminders, and better communication between members, trainers, and gym administrators.

With Django and MySQL, our platform ensures data security, scalability, and efficiency. Our aim is to reduce manual workload, minimize errors, and provide an easy-to-use system for gym management."*

Slide 5: System Users & Modules
🎤 What to Say:
*"Our system consists of four main user roles, each with specific functionalities:

1️⃣ Admin – Manages the entire system, including members, trainers, payments, and reports.
2️⃣ Trainer – Assigns workout schedules, monitors member progress, and provides training videos.
3️⃣ Member – Tracks attendance, accesses diet charts, and purchases gym products.
4️⃣ Guest – Can explore the platform and register for membership.

Each role plays a vital part in making gym management seamless and efficient."*

Slide 6: Existing System vs. Proposed System
🎤 What to Say:
*"Currently, gyms face several challenges due to manual record-keeping, such as:

📌 Time-consuming processes – Maintaining attendance, payments, and schedules manually.
📌 Errors and mismanagement – Lost records, missed payments, and incorrect tracking.
📌 Lack of real-time access – Members cannot check their workout schedules or attendance history remotely.

Our proposed system offers:

✅ Automated attendance tracking – No more manual registers.
✅ Online membership management – Paperless registration and renewals.
✅ Workout plans and progress tracking – Members stay updated on their fitness goals.
✅ Integrated product purchasing – Members can buy gym-related products online.

This digital transformation makes gym operations more organized, accurate, and user-friendly."*
