                <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                    website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work
                    more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                <p>I Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, <span style="color: #8351f9;">[Company
                        Name]</span>) are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website
                    owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
                    functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
                    analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it
                    visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
                <p><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></p>
                <p>We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
                    reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly
                    necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
                    enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites
                    for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
                <p><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></p>
                <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights
                    by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
                    select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as
                    they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
                <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose
                    to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas
                    of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or
                    refuse cookies.</p>
                <p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes
                    they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary

                <p><strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong></p>
                <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar
                    technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear
                    gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize
                    when someone has visited our Websites or opened an email including them. This allows us, for
                    example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to
                    deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an
                    online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure
                    the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on
                    cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
                <p><strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong></p>
                <p>Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local Shared Objects or “LSOs”) to,
                    among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention,
                    and for other site operations.</p>
                <p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash
                    player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the <a
                        href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash
                    Cookies by going to the <a
                        href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the instructions
                    (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies
                    (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on
                    your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash
                    Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>
                <p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce
                    or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications
                    used in connection with our services or online content.</p>
                <p><strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong></p>
                <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our

                    to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may
                    also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can
                    accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and
                    other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential
                    interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to
                    identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose
                    to provide these.</p>
